# Overview

As an aspiring software engineer, I am establishing a clean baseline for future modules and projects: a small well-documented console app with a professional README, demo video, and public repository workflow. This lets me set quality bars for code comments, structure, and documentation.

Software description: 
This is a minimal console application that prints “Hello World!” and a short runtime diagnostic (timestamp, language/runtime version, and operating system). The code is intentionally simple but structured with clearly named functions and a `main` entry point to model good habits for larger projects.

Purpose: 
 Prove out the development environment end-to-end (local run → video demo → public GitHub), demonstrate clear commenting, basic I/O, and simple function design. create a template repository I can clone for later modules to maintain a consistent workflow and documentation style.

# Development Environment

- Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code (with extensions)  
- Version Control: Git + GitHub (public repository)  
- Terminal/Shell: PowerShell / Bash  
- Programming Language: Python 3.11+

Rationale: fast to prototype, widely available, great for quick console utilities.
Key modules used: `datetime` (timestamp), `platform` (runtime/OS diagnostics).
